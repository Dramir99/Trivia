## How This App Works
- Users are first greeted with a home page

- After pressing "PLAY", users are then introduced to a list of possible categories to choose from, or they can click on "QUICKPLAY" where they can play all the possible topics or click "GO BACK" to return to the home page.

- When the user selects a certain topic, that user would then be asked a series of question related to that topic to get quizzed on. The user at any time can press on the "QUIT" button which will exit the user out of the current quiz and back to the categories selection screen.

- When the user gets a question right, the total points for that category will be tallied up and at the end of the quiz, the user's total score will be displayed along with the "LEAVE" button which will redirect the user back to the categories selection screen.
